# lets-learn-our-pokemon

My daughter has been getting excited about pokemon, her current favorite is `Eevee`. She keeps asking me what all the names are and I just don't know that many. I decided to make a little app to teach her to mispronouce all the pokemon names! What better way to be a good dad.

Currently useses `pokeapi.co` and the beta `graphql` endpoint. This enpoint is unstable and this integration needs to be rethought in the long run.

Another goal is to find better audio than the browser text to speech so maybe we can teach her some pronunciations. Google search has a handy interface that seems to handle most pokemon, maybe I can leverage that. I think I smell some `iFrames` in my future.

Some assests as well should be pulled locally to lessen my dependence on others.

## NextJS Stuff

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
